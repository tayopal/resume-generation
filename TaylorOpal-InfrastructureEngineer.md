## Professional Experience

### **Research Data Scientist (Infrastructure Engineer)**
**Oregon Hazards Lab (OHAZ)** | *Eugene, OR* | **Nov 2024 – Sept 2025**

- **Infrastructure & Automation**: Managed infrastructure using clickops, Ansible and GitHub Actions. Built observability stack with VictoriaMetrics/Logs, Grafana, and Fluentd. Developed Github Actions pipeline for code quality checks. Standardized and templatized DNS name creation for consistency.
- **Network Engineering**: Network is a set of radio-connected towers, private backhauls and the public internet. Ensured privacy through VPN tunnels, Mikrotik-to-Mikrotik. Configured network segmentation, firewall rules, Wireguard access controls, and routing (OSPF).
- **Distributed Systems Operations**: Operated remote sensor systems with automated health monitoring, clickops, alerting, and incident response. Reduced response time and operational costs through improved metrics collecting and dashboards, thereby increasing analytics.
- **AI-assisted development**: Used Claude and Cursor to develop a Ruby-based plugin for Fluentd service. Plugin does reverse DNS lookups to annotate log streams for improved analytics.
